# Robot Arm Simulator
Robotic arm manipulator of three planar links.
This is a program that calculates:
 - Direct kinematics Model
 - Inverse kinematics Model
 - The working area using Green's theorem
The program also include:
 - Plotting the working area
 - Generation of straight line trajectory between two points in the working area
 - Robot animation
